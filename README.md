# Art-Store

This project is from the Web Application Development course taught by Randy Connolly at Mount Royal University completed by two other classmates and myself. This project utilizes a three tier design (presentation, business, and data layers). Our project was used as the example for future classes.

Demo coming soon.

Pictures and database are not included in the repo.
